# Transaction Sentinel – Fraud Detection System

## CYBERSECURITY CHALLENGE – FULL DETAILS (INTERMEDIATE LEVEL)

### Description

A real-time, AI-powered system to combat financial fraud. The model analyzes transaction patterns, user behavior (time of day, location, purchase amount), and device data to instantly flag suspicious activity. The solution is trained on a dataset of transactions to learn what constitutes normal behavior for a user and can detect anomalies with high accuracy, minimizing false positives and protecting both customers and businesses from financial loss.

### Key Requirements

- A real-time data processing pipeline capable of handling high volumes of transactions
- An anomaly detection model trained on user-specific and general transaction patterns
- Secure integration with financial systems and payment gateways
- A dashboard for fraud analysts to review and act on flagged transactions
- Compliance with financial data security standards (e.g., PCI DSS)

### Outcomes

- Quantifiable reduction in fraudulent transaction losses
- Low false-positive rate to ensure legitimate transactions are not blocked unnecessarily
- Improved trust and security for customers

### Conditions

- Access to large volumes of anonymized transaction data is essential for training the model
- The system must operate with very low latency to approve or flag transactions in real-time
- The model must be adaptable to changing fraud patterns
